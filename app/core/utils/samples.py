Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to 
natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. Leading AI textbooks define 
the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment 
and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Some popular accounts 
use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" 
functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are 
often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, 
optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, 
having become a routine technology.
